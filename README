To compile the code:
Type make in the rstartree/src/ directory. Run the compiled unittest file.

Data and queries files: 
The files should use the following format:
    a. each line represents one record/query
    b. each record consists of latitude and longitude separated
    by a white space, note that you can modify the unittest.cc code to accept rectangular records instead of points.
    c. each query is a rectangle with two points
    Here is an example of a record:
    42.3631 -71.065
    Here is an example of a query:
    55.9551 -159.067 56.5551 -158.467
